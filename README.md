# Maching Learning Series

Hi Friends,

* I am creating machine learning series in which I will try my best to share applied machine learning Techniques used in ML project development. 
* I will be using pythong language for development in will we are going to learn `sklearn`, `tensorflow`, `keras` for machine learning modeling. I am using `seaborn` for data visualisation.
* I am also going to create video series for these projects **stay tuned :)**
